Ṣaḥīḥ al-Adhkār is about creating standardized files for the book _Ṣaḥīḥ al-Adhkār_ by Shaykh al-Albānī, that was compiled and organized by Ibn al-hasan muhammad ibn hassan al-shaykh (May Allāh have mercy on both of them).

This repo includes the raw XML [content](./content/content.xml) as well as script examples to [parse the XML to JSON](./index.ts) remotely from this repo or locally.

The aim is to provide developers an ease of consumption of the content and a wide variety of file format as the project grows.
